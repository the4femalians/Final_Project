<div class="text">Muse is a website created by four teenagers to help others with their learning ability in music. We have 
gathered as much information as we could to help you out on your journey in the world of music. Our website 
helps you to learn about the key signatures, time signatures, the treble clef, bass clef, and of courseabout
us. We all have some form of interest in music and thought that it would be cool to help others out in learning 
it as well. If you would like to learn the basics of music to help you learn your instrument, then you came to 
the right place. 

If you have any questions or concerns about our website, contact us @</div>
