<div class="text">The Wikipedia definition for 'key signature' is "The relative minor is a minor
third down from the major, regardless of whether it is a flat or a sharp key signature. The key 
signatures with seven flats (♭) and seven sharps (♯) are rarely used because they have simpler 
enharmonic equivalents."
